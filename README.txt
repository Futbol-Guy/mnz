Thank you for installing Never Miss a Class! 

This README file contains information regarding how the program works and, more specifically,
how you should use it.

1. Set Up - Font and Startup
###########################################

There are two large optional features that are included within the program which must be 
installed manually: launching the app on startup and custom font.

~Startup

Making the program launch on startup is very useful since it reminds you to run the program 
each day. To do this, navigate to the folder where you installed the the program and create a 
shortcut to the excecutable NMAC file. Paste this shortcut into your Startup folder, found at
C:\Users\[yourname]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

Once the shortcut is pasted here your program will launch automatically. For further 
instruction, visit the MNAC blog: http://nmacvlc.blogspot.ca/p/tutorial.html

~Font

The custom font is the standard font used by the program. To install this extract the 
"minecraft.ttf" file from "minecraft.zip" found in the Never Miss a Class folder. Place this 
file in the Fonts folder found at "Control Panel\Appearance and Personalization\Fonts"

Once the file is pasted in, it will install. Again, for further instruction, visit the MNAC
blog.

2. How to use the Program
########################################

The "Help" section within the program outlines the steps to set up your classes and times.
Further instruction regarding this can be found in the videos on the blog website. Here the
process of using this program outside of the regular school year will be discussed. There
several things to consider regarding this program. 

1) First, the program does not monitor when the school year is done. It will continue to 
launch classes after exams are done. Remember to remove it from the Startup folder once
the semester is complete

2) Second, the program does not account for you intentionally not attending class. If you
would like to miss a class for the day you have to remove it from the run order before 
clicking the "Run" button. If you would like to skip an entire day of class, simply close 
the program. 

3) This program will launch any link. However, if you do not enter a valid URL to the 
class section it will treat the text entered as a search query. It will take the text and
perform a search in your default search engine.

4) Remember that your classes will be launched in your default browser. If your classes are
launching in an undesired browser, check to make sure that your prefered browser is also 
set as the default.
